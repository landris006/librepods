## What is LibrePods?

LibrePods unlocks Apple's exclusive AirPods features on non-Apple devices. Get access to noise control modes, adaptive transparency, ear detection, hearing aid, customized transparency mode, battery status, and more - all the premium features you paid for but Apple locked to their ecosystem.

## Device Compatibility

| Status | Device                | Features                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅      | AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) | Fully supported and tested                                 |
| ✅      | AirPods Pro (3rd Gen) | Fully supported (except heartrate monitoring)              |
| ⚠️      | Other AirPods models  | Basic features (battery status, ear detection) should work |

Most features should work with any AirPods. Currently, I've only got AirPods Pro 2 to test with.

## Key Features

- **Noise Control Modes**: Easily switch between noise control modes without having to reach out to your AirPods to long press
- **Ear Detection**: Controls your music automatically when you put your AirPods in or take them out, and switch to phone speaker when you take them out
- **Battery Status**: Accurate battery levels
- **Head Gestures**: Answer calls just by nodding your head
- **Conversational Awareness**: Volume automatically lowers when you speak
- **Hearing Aid\***
- **Customize Transparency Mode\***
- **Multi-device connectivity\*** (upto 2 devices)
- **Other customizations**:
  - Rename your AirPods
  - Customize long-press actions
  - Few accessibility features
  - And more!

See our [pinned issue](https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods/issues/20) for a complete feature list and roadmap.

## Platform Support

### Linux

The Linux version runs as a system tray app. Connect your AirPods and enjoy:

- Battery monitoring
- Automatic Ear detection
- Conversational Awareness
- Switching Noise Control modes
- Device renaming

> [!NOTE]
> Work in progress, but core functionality is stable and usable.

For installation and detailed info, see the [Linux README](/linux/README.md).

### Android

#### Root Requirement

> [!CAUTION]
> **You must have a rooted device to use LibrePods on Android.** This is due to a [bug in the Android Bluetooth stack](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/371713238). Please upvote the issue by clicking the '+1' icon on the IssueTracker page.
> 
> There are **no exceptions** to the root requirement until Google merges the fix.

## Bluetooth DID (Device Identification) Hook

Turns out, if you change the manufacturerid to that of Apple, you get access to several special features!

### Multi-device Connectivity

Upto two devices can be simultaneously connected to AirPods, for audio and control both. Seamless connection switching. The same notification shows up on Apple device when Android takes over the AirPods as if it were an Apple device ("Move to iPhone"). Android also shows a popup when the other device takes over.

### Accessibility Settings and Hearing Aid

Accessibility settings like customizing transparency mode (amplification, balance, tone, conversation boost, and ambient noise reduction), and loud sound reduction can be configured.

The hearing aid feature can now also be used. Currently it can only be used to adjust the settings, not actually take a hearing test because it requires much more precision. It is much better to use an already available audiogram result.

>[!NOTE]
> To enable these features, enable App Settings -> `act as Apple Device`.
> This only works if you use the Xposed method or patch the library yourself. The root module method does not support this feature currently.

#### Installation Methods

##### Method 1: Xposed Module (Recommended)
This method is less intrusive and should be tried first:

1. Install LSPosed, or another Xposed provider on your rooted device
2. Download the LibrePods app from the releases section, and install it.
3. Enable the Xposed module for the bluetooth app in your Xposed manager.
4. Disable unmount modules for the Bluetooth app if enabled. 
5. Follow the instructions in the app to set up the module.
6. Open the app and connect your AirPods

##### Method 2: Root Module (Backup Option)
If the Xposed method doesn't work for you:

1. Download the `btl2capfix.zip` module from the releases section
2. Install it using your preferred root manager (KernelSU, Apatch, or Magisk).
3. Disable Unmount modules for the Bluetooth aop if enabled. 
4. Reboot your device
5. Connect your AirPods

##### Method 3: Patching it yourself
If you prefer to patch the Bluetooth stack yourself, follow these steps:

1. Look for the library in use by running `lsof | grep libbluetooth`
2. Find the library path (e.g., `/system/lib64/libbluetooth_jni.so`)
3. Find the `l2c_fcr_chk_chan_modes` function in the library
4. Patch the function to always return `1` (true)
5. Repack the library and push it back to the device. You can do this by creating a root module yourself.
6. Reboot your device

If you're unfamiliar with these steps, search for tutorials online or ask in Android rooting communities.

#### A few notes

- Due to recent AirPods' firmware upgrades, you must enable `Off listening mode` to switch to `Off`. This is because in this mode, louds sounds are not reduced!

- If you have take both AirPods out, the app will automatically switch to the phone speaker. But, Android might keep on trying to connect to the AirPods because the phone is still connected to them, just the A2DP profile is not connected. The app tries to disconnect the A2DP profile as soon as it detects that Android has connected again if they're not in the ear.

- When renaming your AirPods through the app, you'll need to re-pair them with your phone for the name change to take effect. This is a limitation of how Bluetooth device naming works on Android.
